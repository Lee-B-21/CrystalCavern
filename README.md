This is a gameplay/mechanic showcase showing you core mechanics of using basic-intermediate-advanced blueprints, itâ€™s NOT meant to be a full blown game. I prefer to showcase the mechanics of how small things in games you wouldnâ€™t notice, actually work such as: a basic UI (pop up message on screen) to how a basic AI moves around via 4 points (in this video theyâ€™re not working as Iâ€™ve been playing around with nodes within their blueprints and forgot to add them back before I made this video).
